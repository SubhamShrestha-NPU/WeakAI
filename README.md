Descartes uses JavaScript to simulate an AI experience. The voice responses come from your browser’s text-to-speech feature, and the web search uses **DuckDuckGo**. If you want more advanced features, you can activate the **Gemini Freemium API**. Just edit the code to swap between DuckDuckGo and Gemini whenever you want. 💻


**Predefined Responses:**  
All responses in Descartes are **preset** in a **JSON file**. That means every response is already written out, and they’re not generated dynamically. This makes sure the answers are quick, consistent, and tailored to fit each personality mode! Whether Descartes is being rude, polite, or intelligent, the response will always match the chosen mode. 🎤
